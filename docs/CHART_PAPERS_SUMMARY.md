## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### 1. **Review the Files**
Open each CHART_*.md file and review the content.

### 2. **Gather Materials**
- Large chart papers (15-20 sheets recommended)
- Markers (multiple colors: blue, red, green, black)
- Ruler
- Pencil (for drafting)

### 3. **Start Creating**
Follow the priority order from `CHART_PAPERS_GUIDE.md`:
- **Must Have:** Charts 1, 2, 4 (Grammar, Lexer, Top-Down)
- **Should Have:** Charts 3, 6 (Symbol Table, Intermediate Code)
- **Nice to Have:** Charts 5, 7 (Bottom-Up, Complete)

### 4. **Time Management**
- Estimated total time: 20-27 hours
- Work 3-4 hours per day = 5-7 days
- Start with the most important charts first

---

## 💡 QUICK TIPS

1. **Use the guide** - `CHART_PAPERS_GUIDE.md` has layout suggestions
2. **Draw in pencil first** - Then trace with marker
3. **Use colors** - Makes diagrams clearer and more professional
4. **Practice DFAs** - They're the trickiest to draw neatly
5. **Leave margins** - Don't write to the edges
6. **Take photos** - Backup your work digitally
